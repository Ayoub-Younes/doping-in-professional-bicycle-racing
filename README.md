# Doping in Professional Bicycle Racing

This is a data visualization project created as part of the Data Visualization Certification from FreeCodeCamp. It uses D3.js to create an interactive scatter plot that visualizes the performance of professional cyclists and highlights those with doping allegations.

## Project Overview

This scatter plot visualizes the performance of professional cyclists in the Tour de France, showing the relationship between their race times and doping allegations. Each point on the scatter plot represents a cyclist, with the x-axis showing the year of the race and the y-axis showing the race time. Points are color-coded based on whether the cyclist has been linked to doping allegations. Tooltips display detailed information when a user hovers over a point, such as the cyclist's name, nationality, year, and race time.
